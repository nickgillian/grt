@brief This class implements the GRT Decision Tree classifier.  Decision Trees are conceptually simple
classifiers that work well on even complex classification tasks.  Decision Trees partition the feature
space into a set of rectangular regions, classifying a new datum by finding which region it belongs to.

@remark This implementation is based on Ross Quinlan's ID3 Decision Tree algorithm: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ID3_algorithm
